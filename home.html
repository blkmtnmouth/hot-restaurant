  <!-- Directions:
    Phase I:
    For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to 
    create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces

* Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.
* Create a basic server using Express.JS
* Create a few array variables that will hold the data
* Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data
* Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages
* Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server

    Phase II:
Create three HTML files one called home.html, another called tables.html, and another called reserve.html. Use dummy data and create pages similar to the one shown to you on the sample Hot Reservation webpage.
All: If you finish early, begin thinking about how the Data, API, and Routes should look.
